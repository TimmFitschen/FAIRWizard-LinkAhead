# Hackathon Roadmap

1. Creating a minimal example synchronization from FAIRWizard to LinkAhead
  * IndiScale will create a minimal python script setting up a trivial schema (RecordType "Contributer" with Property "Full Name"). The script creates Contributer Records from a list of string.
  * Codevence will create a minimal python script for fetching all contributers's names of a Project into a list of strings.
  * Then connect both scripts.

2. Proposal: Extend the minimal example to do the synchronization in the reverse direction

3. Proposal: Then decide how to proceed.
